# Android challenge
We would like to learn more about how you approach a challenge as an Android Engineer.
There is a simple app that displays customer reviews for one of our most popular activities. 
The challenge will be composed of a pair programming session, where we are going to add a missing feature.


We’ll evaluate platform, architecture, testing, and problem solving-knowledge.

What you’ll need:
- Java 11 and Android Studio configured
